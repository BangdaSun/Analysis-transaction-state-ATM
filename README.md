# Analysis-transaction-state-ATM
ATM system has front-end and back-end, where the front-end is the ATM and back-end is the data processing system. Customer will submit request from the front-end, then the request will be sent to the back-end and the result will be sent back to the front-end. This is the whole process of transaction.
